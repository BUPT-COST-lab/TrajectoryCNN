# PredCNN
This is a TensorFlow implementation of [PredCNN](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0408.pdf), an entire convolutional model for video prediction as described in the following paper: 

**PredCNN: Predictive Learning with Cascade Convolutions**, by Ziru Xu, Yunbo Wang, Mingsheng Long and Jianmin Wang.

## Setup
Required python libraries: tensorflow (>=1.0) + opencv + numpy.
Tested in ubuntu/centOS + nvidia titan X (Pascal) with cuda (>=8.0) and cudnn (>=5.0).

## Datasets
We conduct experiments on one video dataset, [Moving Mnist](https://github.com/xzr12/PredCNN/tree/master/data/moving-mnist-example), and two crowd flow dataset, [TaxiBJ and BikeNYC](https://github.com/lucktroy/DeepST/tree/master/data).
For other video format datasets, please extract frames from original video clips and move them to the `data/` folder.

## Training
Use the `scripts/train.sh` script to train the model. To train the default model on Moving MNIST simply use:
```shell
cd scripts;sh train.sh;
```
You might want to change the `--train_data_paths`, `--valid_data_paths` and `--save_dir` which point to paths on your system to download the data to, and where to save the checkpoints.

To train on your own dataset, have a look at the `InputHandle` classes in the `data_provider/` folder. You have to write an analogous iterator object for your own dataset. 

At inference, the generated future frames will be saved in the `--results` folder.
